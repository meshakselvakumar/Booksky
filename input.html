            <h5>Robert</h5>
            <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is about Robert Kiyosaki and his two dads—his real father (poor dad) and the father of his best friend (rich dad)—and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. You don't need to earn a high income to be rich. Rich people make money work for them. .The most important lesson from Rich Dad, Poor Dad is that financial literacy is crucial to financial success. He argues that school education fails in this regard and needs to effectively teach financial literacy, including the basics of financial management and wealth building</p>
